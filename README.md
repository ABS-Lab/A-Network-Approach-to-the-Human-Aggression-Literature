Abstract of the paper:
How are scientists able to develop expertise in aggression research given the
accelerating volume of literature being published? Here, we used seed-based 
citation network analysis to model the topology of literature on human aggression.
A citation matrix consisting of 7447 articles that either directly cited the seed
article or a child of the seed article. A graph theoretic analysis of this matrix
recovered 15 research communities on aggression. The five largest communities were 
“media & video-games”, “stress, traits & aggression”, “rumination &
displaced aggression”, “role of testosterone”, and “social aggression”. 
We further used graph theoretic measures to identify the most influential papers both
within and across communities, and the “bridging” articles that linked distinct
communities to one another. We also looked at the percentage of male and
female first authors within communities to determine if the citation network
analysis would introduce greater opportunities to reduce gender discrepancy in
literature review relative to simply relying on the most popularly cited articles
on aggression. We observed that the percentage of articles with female first
authors was doubled to 32% when identifying influential articles by community
structure, whereas this percentage was reduced to 16% when looking at the
papers ranked by number of citations. The literature topology may provide a
valuable resource for aggression researchers by outlining research communities
on aggression, influential papers within each community, and opportunities to
increase gender equity in the field.
